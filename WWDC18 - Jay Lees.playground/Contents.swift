//: ## Connect 4: AR
//: **Developed by Jay Lees**
//:
//: My playground utilises SceneKit, UIKit and ARKit to create an interactive 3D model the popular game "Connect 4".
//: The aim of the game is simple: make a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line of discs by dropping them from the top of the board (just tap the ðŸ”» on the top of each row).
//: The game requires two players, with the red player starting first!
//: Since this playground utilises the device's camera, it requires Swift Playgrounds for iPad! For the best experience, make the view full screen!
